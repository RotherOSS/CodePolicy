# Introduction

CodePolicy is a general code quality checker that can also make changes to the code.
You can use it to check your code against the OTOBO code style guide.

# How it can be used

- manually
- as a pre commit hook that validates your local changes
- as a pre receive filter that checks what you push to git.otobo.org
- as a unit test that you can run locally and also runs on the UT servers (for the framework)
